 * A port I/O bus is a bus on which devices are accessed via IN and

 * Intel 8259A interrupt controller can be regarded as a device
 * connected to a port I/O bus.
 * On x86 systems, kernel can directly communicate to this port I/O bus.
 * On other architectures/platforms such as MIPS or PowerPC, IN and OUT
 * instructions are simulated by memory accesses at some address space,
 * in which case we can view this port I/O bus as being connected to a
 * memory bus.
 *
 * Every machine have at most one port I/O bus.
