/*
 * A directory consists of some number of blocks of e2fs_bsize bytes.
 *
 * Each block contains some number of directory entry
 * structures, which are of variable length.  Each directory entry has
 * a struct direct at the front of it, containing its inode number,
 * the length of the entry, and the length of the name contained in
 * the entry.  These are followed by the name padded to a 4 byte boundary
 * with null bytes.  All names are guaranteed null terminated.
 * The maximum length of a name in a directory is EXT2FS_MAXNAMLEN.
 *
 * The macro EXT2FS_DIRSIZ(fmt, dp) gives the amount of space required to
 * represent a directory entry.  Free space in a directory is represented by
 * entries which have dp->e2d_reclen > DIRSIZ(fmt, dp).  All d2fs_bsize bytes
 * in a directory block are claimed by the directory entries.  This
 * usually results in the last entry in a directory having a large
 * dp->e2d_reclen.  When entries are deleted from a directory, the
 * space is returned to the previous entry in the same directory
 * block by increasing its dp->e2d_reclen.  If the first entry of
 * a directory block is free, then its dp->e2d_ino is set to 0.
 * Entries other than the first in a directory do not normally have
 * dp->e2d_ino set to 0.
 * Ext2 rev 0 has a 16 bits e2d_namlen. For Ext2 rev 1 this has been split
 * into a 8 bits e2d_namlen and 8 bits e2d_type (looks like ffs, isnt't it ? :)
 * It's safe to use this for rev 0 as well because all ext2 are little-endian.
