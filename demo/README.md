Demo directory
==========

Put hardware demo sources (e.g. an example of reading disk sectors,
an example of writing characters to a serial console) here as
quick references of how to use those devices end-to-end, to allow
users interested in driver framework design focus on framework itself
rather than hardware specifications (as they are very boring).
